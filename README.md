# Eye-Exercise

This was an exercise from week 8 of the MIT xPro Program. This assignment combined Javascript, CSS, and HTML to create a webpage where two eyes follow the movement of your mouse.

# How to Run

## Step 1:
To make future improvements, download the files in the repository and open in the IDE of your choosing. I recommend Visual Studio Code or XCode.

## Step 2: 
Open the eyes.js file in the IDE. This is where you can make any changes to the code to change the movement of the eyes, add on click code, etc.. Save any changes. 

## Step 3:
Open the style.css file to make any future changes to the look of the html.

## Step 4: 
Open the index.html file in a web browswer.
